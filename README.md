This repository includes my entry for the DigData Career Challenge, a data-driven project 
that evaluates communication, analytical thinking, and data interpretation abilities. 
The task was to examine UK travel patterns and provide guidance for future transportation policy 
by evaluating a fictitious dataset that the Department for Transport supplied. 

Extracting data, seeing important patterns and insights, and suggesting tactics to deal 
with new travel habits were among the tasks. In order to solve actual transportation problems, 
this study shows how data storytelling, critical thinking, and evidence-based decision-making 
can be applied practically.

In order to respond to the question, "How do different travel choices affect carbon footprint, 
and what are the best travel options for environmentally friendly outcomes?" the task entailed 
analyzing multiple datasets pertaining to UK travel habits, emissions, and congestion.

I cleaned, combined, analyzed, visualized, and did regression modeling on three datasets (congestion, 
emissions, and festival_journeys) using R and Python.  

The results offer practical suggestions for sustainable travel habits together with information 
on the most time- and environmentally-efficient forms of transportation.

Skills used:
* Python
* R

The following libraries were installed in R for smooth functioning of the project:
"readxl", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "stringr", "GGally", "ggfortify"
